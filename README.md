# ECON-5243-Econometrics-II
This repository includes Ian's solutions to ECON-5243 coding problem sets (2023 spring semester at The University of Oklahoma). OU PhD students should use this resource as a reference instead of an answer key or a cheat sheet. In addition, comments on better coding or error correction are welcomed.
